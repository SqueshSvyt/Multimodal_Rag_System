RAPTOR retrieves original text or summaries at varying levels of detail, depending on the LLM's input length limit. By iteratively summarizing and clustering text excerpts from a corpus of 1,600 research papers, RAPTOR creates a graduated series of summaries. At inference, it computes the similarity between the user's prompt and each excerpt and summary, retrieving the highest-scoring ones to prepend to the input.

This process can be repeated multiple times, allowing the LLM to spot gaps and improve its output on tasks such as code generation, text writing, and question answering. The author also explores implementing Reflection using a multi-agent framework, where one agent generates output and another agent provides constructive criticism.

When developing AI products, two major sources of uncertainty exist: users and data. An iterative approach, involving a minimum viable product (MVP) or proof of concept, helps mitigate these risks by providing valuable feedback and allowing for adjustments. Unlike non-iterative projects, such as medical drug development or space telescope construction, AI projects benefit from quick and low-cost testing, enabling teams to address hidden issues and make informed decisions about user needs and data quality, ultimately leading to more successful AI products.',\n",

On June 28, nearly 60 cars stalled, blocking lanes and crosswalks, while on May 18, the entire fleet lost connectivity for 20 minutes. These incidents highlight challenges in rolling out self-driving cars, including reliance on remote servers and vulnerability to hacking.',\n",

The revised guidelines restrict access to certain AI capabilities on Azure Cloud, requiring new customers to apply for access to face recognition and text-to-speech services. Developers must assess AI systems for societal impact, document systems thoroughly, and ensure fairness and safety. Microsoft provides nearly 20 tools to aid compliance, aiming to address growing concerns about AI harm and set a proactive example in the absence of comprehensive regulation.',\n",

While these techniques boost overall performance, they can degrade accuracy on specific classes. For instance, altering colors in training images can help models recognize objects despite color variations but disrupt learning from certain patterns, such as classifying basketballs by color. The study trained ResNets on ImageNet images with varying augmentations and weight decay, finding that accuracy improved on some classes but decreased on others, emphasizing caution when using techniques that improve overall performance.\"',\n",
